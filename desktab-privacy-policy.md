# Privacy Policy for Desktab

**Last Updated:** 28/01/2026

## 1. Overview

Our core philosophy is "Privacy First." Desktab is designed to work without collecting any personal information or browsing data. All processing happens locally on your device and never leaves your browser.

Desktab is entirely open source. You can review the complete source code at: https://github.com/aiibe/desktab

## 2. Data Collection & Usage

- **No Personal Data:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or physical locations.

- **No Browsing History:** We do not track, log, or sell your browsing history or online activity.

- **No Persistent Storage:** Desktab does not store any data. All information displayed in the tab switcher exists only in memory while the overlay is open and is discarded immediately when closed.

- **No Network Requests:** Desktab makes zero external network requests. All functionality runs entirely within your browser with no data ever leaving your device.

## 3. Permissions Justification

Desktab requests only the minimum permissions necessary to function:

- **"Tabs":** Required to query your open tabs, switch between tabs, and close tabs. This is the core functionality of the extension.

## 4. Third Parties

Because we do not collect any data, we do not share, sell, or trade any information with third parties. There are no hidden trackers or analytics scripts bundled within the extension.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
